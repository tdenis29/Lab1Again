# Lab1Again

Hey Don,

I have all of my work and reasoning shown in Lab1Again.md file and I have a final copy in the Word file called Lab1FinishedTysonDenis.docx file. Theres about 1009 words in my Lab1Again.md file.


Here is my short writeup.


1. I liked the lab but got bogged down in the 3NF of the Bills view. To be honest I just gave up, and handed it in because I have a real mess with composite keys and my eyes were crossing.
2. It took a long time, around 10 hours for this lab,2 hours Wednesday January 24th, 4 hours January 26th and 4 hours between yesterday February 1st and today February 2nd. But I also did Memories Forever and JoesVideos so in total since Wednesday January 24th I've spent upwards of 20 hours on this stuff.
3. I did not feel prepared as I am not used to learning this way. I feel like handing in the first assignment that is worth almost 10% of final grade without any marked practice was very difficult. I could not have done this in Math for example and if I did, I certainly wouldnt have done very well.
4. My only suggestion would be can we please hand something in for marks before the labs so we know we are on the right track with the normalization process.
